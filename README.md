# Conservation Statistics

Conservation Statistics is an R toolkit for forestry survey analysis: plot and stand summaries for Yale conservation research.

The project converts raw forestry survey data into reproducible plot-level and stand-level summaries. It was developed for researchers at the [Yale School of the Environment](https://environment.yale.edu/) to analyze 2022 and 2023 field survey results across treatment, tree, regeneration, and damage metrics.

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harleyhzhang/Conservation_statistics
```

## Outputs

- Plot-level summary CSVs for 2022 and 2023 surveys.
- Stand-level summary CSVs for forest stand analysis.
- R scripts for regenerating summaries from cleaned survey data.

## Plot Statistics

### Treatment statistics:
- **Treatment year:** The year each plot was treated.
- **Treatment type:** Types of treatment used within a plot.

### Tree statistics:
- **Basal area per acre:** Calculates basal area in inches per acre for living trees.
- **Average diameter at breast height (DBH):** Calculates the average DBH in inches per acre for living trees.
- **Average height:** Calculates the average height in feet for living trees.
- **Dominant tree species:** Identifies the dominant tree species per plot, considering survey, frequency, and if the dominant one is less than or equal to 50% frequency, also determines the second-dominant tree species.

### Regeneration statistics:
- **Regeneration presence:** Checks if regeneration (saplings or seedlings) is present in each plot.
- **Seedlings per acre:** Calculates the number of seedlings per acre.
- **Dominant regeneration species:** Identifies the dominant regeneration (sapling/seedling) species per plot, considering survey, frequency, and if the dominant one is less than or equal to 50% frequency, also determines the second-dominant regeneration species.

### Damage statistics:
- **Insect presence:** Determines if insect damage is present in each plot (Y/N).
- **Browse presence:** Identifies if browse damage is present in each plot (Y/N).
- **List of damage types:** Lists each type of damage present in each plot.

## Forest Stand Statistics

### Tree statistics:
- **Basal area per acre:** Calculates basal area in inches per acre for living trees.
- **Average diameter at breast height (DBH):** Calculates the average DBH in inches per acre for living trees.
- **Average height:** Calculates the average height in feet for living trees.
- **Dominant tree species:** Identifies the dominant tree species in each stand and calculates the number and percent of plots.

### Regeneration statistics:
- **Regeneration presence:** Calculates the number and percent of plots with regeneration (saplings or seedlings) in each stand.
- **Seedlings per acre:** Calculates the average number of seedlings per acre in each stand.
- **Dominant regeneration species:** Identifies the dominant regeneration (sapling/seedling) species in each stand and calculates the number and percent of plots.

### Damage statistics:
- **Insect damage presence::** Calculates the number and percent of plots with insect damage in each stand.
- **Browse damage presence::** Calculates the number and percent of plots with browsing damage in each stand.
- **List of damage types:** Lists all damage present across all plots within a stand.

## Tech Stack

- R
- CSV survey datasets
- Reproducible data analysis scripts

## Project Context

The analysis supports conservation research by standardizing forestry measurements into reusable summaries. Plot scripts produce per-plot metrics, while stand scripts aggregate those measurements into stand-level statistics for treatment and ecosystem analysis.
